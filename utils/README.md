These are often things like git submodules.

## [MyActuator Motor Drivers](./myactuator_rmd)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> THIS MUST BE INSTALLED FOR THIS PACKAGE TO WORK AS INTENDED!!!

[myactuator_rmd](https://github.com/2b-t/myactuator_rmd) are the motor drivers for the [MYACTUATOR](https://www.myactuator.com/) series motors.
However the company and it's software are of Chinese origin, so we do not actually make it a submodule...
Instead, we require manual install and add the instructions in the [README](../README.md#manually-add-the-myactuator_rmd).
