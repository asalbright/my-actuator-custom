# Robotics Research and Development

The Robotics Research and Development project is one established to figure a path to get more involved in some of the more cutting edge robotics work happening both commercially and through NASA.
The project is kicking off in the summer of 2025, being headed by John MacLean.
Interns David MacLean and Jackie Shen will contribute the initial project, which is TBD.

## About

This repo acts as a python package to run the robot developed during the 2025 summer internship.
It exists as a non-METECS repo due to the need of motor drivers that are Chinese based software that CANNOT be added to the METECS Gitlab or be run a computer connected to the METECS WiFi &ndash; which is needed to clone from the METECS Gitlab.

## Installation

### Clone the repo using

```sh
git clone https://github.com/asalbright/my-actuator-custom.git && cd my-actuator-custom
```

### Manually Add the [`myactuator_rmd`]([link_here](https://github.com/2b-t/myactuator_rmd))

```sh
cd utils/
git clone https://github.com/2b-t/myactuator_rmd
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The software listed above is software that is generated by a Chinese company and therefore CANNOT be installed on a computer with access to the main network.
> It can ONLY BE INSTALLED TO A machine on the GUEST network.
>
### Generate the Python Virtual Environment

```sh
cd .. # You should be back in the my-actuator-custom repo
uv sync
```

> [!TIP]
> You must [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to fully utilize this package.
> You may also use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)... but this has not been tested.  

## Usage

### Set Up the CAN

#### Check the status of the CAN

```sh
ip link show can0
```

#### Setup the CAN Bitrate

```sh
sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 1000000
```

#### Set the CAN to `up`

```sh
sudo ip link set up can0
```

### Running the Scripts

```sh
uv run scripts/<name-of-script>
```
